Toronto-Neighbourhood-Segmentation-and-Clustering In this assignment, it is required to explore, segment, and cluster the neighbourhoods in the city of Toronto based on the postal code and borough information. For the Toronto neighbourhood data, a Wikipedia page exists that has all the information needed to explore and cluster the neighbourhoods in Toronto. It will be required to scrape the Wikipedia page and wrangle the data, clean it, and then read it into a pandas data frame. Once the data is in a structured format, you can replicate the analysis to explore and cluster the neighbourhoods in the city of Toronto. I want to clearly shows the maps of various analysis cluster analysis, i therefore add images of my work on Toronto analysis. This is shown in the Microsoft word document (.dox).
